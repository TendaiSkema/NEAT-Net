## Overview

Attempt to make a NEAT algorythm that produces networks that themselfs can learn.
This project give a kind of compileing rule for DAG Neural networks that can handle reccurent connections.
The NEAT algorythm tries to evolve a Network that has the abitllity to learn the given task instead of optimizing for the task directly.
